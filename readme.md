### This repository maintains demonstration videos for our paper

We use srsRAN 4G network and custom built Man-in-the-middle (MiM) node to perform attack on the network
This repository the following four videos that show attack and detection mechanisms
1. Normal Operation of the network without MiM
2. Half duplex MiM attack and detection
3. Full duplex MiM attack and detection
4. Double full duplex attack and detection
